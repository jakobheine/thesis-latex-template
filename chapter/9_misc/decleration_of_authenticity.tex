\addchap{Decleration of Authenticity}

I declare that I wrote this thesis on my own and did not use any unnamed sources or aid. Thus, to the best of my knowledge and belief, this thesis contains no material previously published or written by another person except where due reference is made by correct citation. This includes any thoughts taken over directly or indirectly from printed books and articles as well as all kinds of online material. It also includes my own translations from sources in a different language. The work contained in this thesis has not been previously submitted for examination. I also agree that the thesis may be tested for plagiarized content with the help of plagiarism software. I am aware that failure to comply with the rules of good scientific practice has grave consequences and may result in expulsion from the program.
